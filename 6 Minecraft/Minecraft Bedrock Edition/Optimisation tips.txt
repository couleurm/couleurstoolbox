1. Turn off custom skies, if you have an APU, this will boost your fps by around 20-30 fps
2. Turn off smooth lighting and antialiasing, these are very gpu heavy tasks.
3. Why have fancy graphics on... there's no competitive advantage, nothing really looks better
or worse
4. Render distance doesn't really matter on bedrock edition servers, as long as it's not above
the default maximum value, I doubt your fps will change much
